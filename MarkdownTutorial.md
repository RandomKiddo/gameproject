### Starting Markdown

There are two types of markdown: single line markdown, and multi-line markdown.

To start single line markdone, just use one backtick \` and then type your part, then end with another backtick \`
It should look something like this: `hello`

For multi-line markdown, use three backticks \`\`\`, type whatever you need, then end with three backticks \`\`\`
Multi-line markdown is useful because it can do code highlighting. The way you do this is by adding the programming language name after the first set of backticks. For example, for python, I could do \`\`\`py, and then I would get python highlighted code.

Here is an example:
```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args) {
  Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
}
```

Here's all the keys for programming languages you can use with multi-line markdown.
| Language      | Key |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Java      | java       |
| C   | c        |
| C++ | c++ `or` cpp |
| Javascript | js `or` javascript |
| C# | csharp `or` cs |
| Swift | swift |
| HTML | html |
| CSS | css |
| PHP | php |
| SQL | sql |

| Ruby | ruby |
