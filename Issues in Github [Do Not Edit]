How to use "Issues" tab in Github!

Issues is a good place to put issues on our code or script.

Here's how you report an issue:

1. Navigate to the issues tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Give it a meaningful title and give a detailed response of the issue and maybe even how to recreate it. Markdown is supported, so please use it. You can click the tab "Preview" to preview your issue and see how it will look once posted.
4. On the right hand side, under "Labels" pick one or more labels that represent the issue, and under "Projects" select "Python File Board"
5. Click "Submit New Issue"

If you want to see an example, go to the issues tab and click where it says "1 Closed", and click on my "Example Issue".
