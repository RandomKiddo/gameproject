### Basics of NCL Github

_This will be an overview of how to use Github without the command line (NCL = No Command Line)_

1. Find the files you want to upload. Make sure they are the correct format and file extension.
2. Navigate to [this repository's homepage](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/gameproject) and then navigate to the folder you want to upload in
3. Drag the files from wherever they are on your device and drop them in the window in Github
4. Where it says "Commit New File" in the first box, add a small and concise description of the file(s) uploaded. 
5. Click "Commit ..."

A note about github file uploading: If a file is already present, it will not create two files. Instead, github will replace the old file, as it recognizes that you are trying to update an old file. If there is no file with the name present it just adds it. Please do not edit or override someone else's file (without their permission at least).

### Issues in Github

_This will show you how issues work in Github_

Issues is a good way to bring attention to issues in our code

How to report an issue:
1. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/gameproject/issues) tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Give it a meaningful title and give a detailed response of the issue and maybe even how to recreate it. Markdown is supported, so please use it. You can click the tab "Preview" to preview your issue and see how it will look once posted. We will be using Issue Templates in the future!
4. On the right hand side, under "Labels" pick one or more labels that represent the issue. If you know someone who can definitely fix it, select them under "Assignees"
5. Click "Submit New Issue"

See an example [here](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/gameproject/issues/1)
