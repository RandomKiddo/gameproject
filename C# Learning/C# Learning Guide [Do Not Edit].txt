For Weeks 5-6 of our C# Learning, you will have to do the project at the end of the book

Finish the project and name it in the format "c#_name". So my file name would be "c#_neil".

Commit the file under the "C# Learning" folder and commit it directly to the master branch (See Github Help document). 

Do not edit this document, or anyone else's.

If you wish to update your file, just commit the new file and make sure it has the same name as the old file in order to override the old one.
